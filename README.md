# AndroidEmulatorLauncher
This little Python script will launch the given emulator and wait it to be booted properly.

### Why?
Well I needed this kind of functionality in Jenkins and because [Android Emulator plugin was not working for the newer emulator](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin#AndroidEmulatorPlugin-Knownissues) this had to be done.
